# Telegram Goose Bot

A Python service that bridges Telegram with Goose CLI, maintaining persistent conversation context and providing agent management capabilities.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**This bot automatically approves tool execution requests from Goose.** Goose can execute commands, modify files, and access your system resources. Only use this bot:
- On systems you control
- With trusted Telegram users (configure `authorized_user` in settings)
- When you understand the security implications

**The author is not responsible for any damage, data loss, or security issues that may occur from running this software on your system.** Use at your own risk.

## Features

- **Persistent Session**: Maintains Goose CLI sessions with structured communication
- **Agent Management**: Create, switch, and manage Goose agents with isolated contexts
- **Conversation Persistence**: Save and restore conversation sessions with session IDs
- **Attachment Support**: Send images (native ACP support) and documents to Goose
- **Voice Messages**: Automatic speech-to-text transcription via Whisper
- **Real-time Progress**: See tool execution status as Goose works
- **Clean Communication**: Structured JSON-RPC protocol (no ANSI parsing needed)
- **User Filtering**: Only responds to authorized user (configurable)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and automatic recovery
- **Fast Cancellation**: Immediate response to cancel commands

## Real-time Progress Updates

The bot shows what Goose is doing in real-time:
- **Tool Execution**: "🔧 Execute Bash..." when running commands
- **Command Output**: Stdout/stderr from executed commands (truncated if >2000 bytes)
- **File Operations**: "🔧 Fs Read..." when reading files
- **Progress Indicators**: Typing indicators during long operations

This helps you understand what Goose is working on during longer tasks.

**Command Output Behavior**: When you run a command, you'll see:
1. Tool execution notification (e.g., "🔧 Running: echo hello")
2. Command stdout/stderr output (if any)
3. Goose's summary/analysis of the result

Long outputs are automatically truncated to show the first 1000 and last 1000 bytes.

## Attachment Support

Send images and documents directly to Goose for analysis, code review, or processing.

### Supported File Types
- **Photos**: JPEG, PNG, WebP (up to 10 MB)
- **Documents**: Any file type (up to 20 MB)

### Usage
Simply send a photo or document to the bot with an optional caption:
```
[Send image with caption: "What's in this image?"]
[Send Python file with caption: "Review this code"]
[Send document without caption - Goose will receive the file path]
```

### Configuration
Set the attachments directory in `settings.ini`:
```ini
[bot]
attachments_dir = ~/.goose/bot_attachments
```

Files are saved with the pattern: `{timestamp}_{user_id}_{filename}`

### How It Works
1. Bot downloads the attachment to the configured directory
2. For images: Sends via ACP's native image content type
3. For documents: Includes file path in message text
4. Goose can read, analyze, or process the file as needed

**Note**: Image attachments use ACP's native image content type for better integration.

## Voice Messages

Send voice messages or audio files to the bot — they are automatically transcribed to text and sent to Goose.

### How It Works
1. Send a voice message or audio file to the bot
2. Bot shows "🎤 Transcribing..." while processing
3. Speech is transcribed using [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (Whisper small model, int8, CPU)
4. Transcription is sent to Goose as: `[Voice message transcription (Xs)]: "your words"`
5. Goose responds to the transcribed text

### Supported Formats
- **Voice messages**: Telegram's native voice recordings (OGG/Opus)
- **Audio files**: Any audio file sent as an attachment

### Details
- Uses VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to skip silence
- Whisper model is lazy-loaded on first voice message (avoids startup overhead)
- Transcription runs in a background thread to keep the bot responsive
- Works in both 1-to-1 chats and group topics

## Bot Commands

**Note:** Telegram bot commands use backslash (`\`) prefix, not forward slash (`/`).

### Managing Agents
```
\agent list           # List all available agents with their working directories
\agent swap <name>    # Switch to a different agent
\agent create <name>  # Create a new agent (interactive flow)
\agent delete <name>  # Delete an existing agent
```

### Operation Control
```
\cancel               # Cancel the current running operation (immediate response)
```

### Context Management
```
\context              # Show current context usage percentage
\compact              # Trigger manual conversation compaction
```

**Context Usage Warnings**: The bot automatically monitors context usage and sends warnings:
- ⚠️ Warning at 80%: "Consider using \compact"
- 🚨 Alert at 90%: "Recommend compacting now"

### Model Management
```
\model list           # List all available models and show current model
\model <model_id>     # Set the model for the current session
```

Examples:
```
\model list                    # Show available models
\model claude-sonnet-4.5       # Switch to Claude Sonnet 4.5
\model claude-opus-4.6         # Switch to Claude Opus 4.6
```

### Limitations

**Usage/Billing Command**: The `/usage` command is listed in `_goose.dev/commands/available` but does not work via `_goose.dev/commands/execute` in ACP mode. When called, goose returns zero messages (no RPC response, no notifications), causing the request to hang indefinitely until timeout. This is likely a terminal-only UI command. To check your account usage and credits, use the regular CLI:
```bash
goose chat
/usage
```

### Configuring Agent Working Directories

Each agent can be configured to start in a specific project directory. Edit `~/.goose/bot_agent_config.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "facebook_dev": {
      "working_directory": "/home/mark/git/facebook"
    },
    "goose_default": {
      "working_directory": "/home/mark/git/telegram-goose-bot"
    }
  },
  "default_directory": "/home/mark/git/telegram-goose-bot"
}
```

When you switch to an agent, Goose will start in that agent's configured directory. This allows different agents to work on different projects without manual directory changes.

## How Multi-Agent System Works

The bot maintains multiple Goose CLI processes simultaneously, one for each agent:

1. **Independent Sessions**: Each agent runs in its own Goose CLI process with separate context
2. **Agent Switching**: Use `\agent swap <name>` to switch between active agents
3. **Lazy Loading**: Agent processes are only started when first accessed
4. **Working Directories**: Each agent starts in its configured project directory
5. **Automatic Mode Switching**: When switching agents, the bot automatically sets the goose mode to match the agent name (if a matching mode exists)
6. **Context Isolation**: Conversations and context are isolated per agent
7. **Concurrent Agents**: Multiple agents can be running simultaneously, but only one is active at a time

### Automatic Mode Switching

When you swap to an agent (e.g., `\agent swap facebook`), the bot automatically:
1. Switches to the agent's goose process
2. Changes to the agent's working directory
3. Sets the goose mode to match the agent name (if available)

This gives each agent the right context automatically. If no matching mode exists, the agent continues with the default mode.

### Agent Lifecycle
- **Creation**: `\agent create <name>` - Interactive flow to define agent properties
- **Activation**: First message to an agent or `\agent swap` starts its Goose process
- **Switching**: `\agent swap <name>` switches active agent without stopping others
- **Deletion**: `\agent delete <name>` removes agent definition (stops process if running)

### Use Cases
- **Project Separation**: Different agents for different codebases (e.g., `facebook_dev`, `goose_default`)
- **Role Specialization**: Agents with different instructions for specific tasks
- **Context Management**: Keep separate conversation contexts for different projects

## Group Topics

Use a Telegram group with forum topics enabled to interact with multiple agents simultaneously — each topic maps to one agent.

### Setup

1. Create a Telegram group and enable "Topics" in group settings
2. Add the bot to the group and make it admin (needs `can_manage_topics` permission)
3. Create topics named after your agents (case-insensitive matching)
4. Or use `\topic sync` in any topic to auto-create topics for all agents

### Configuration

Add to `settings.ini`:
```ini
[group]
# Optional: restrict to specific group ID
# group_id = -1003610178913
# Path to topic-agent mapping cache
topic_cache = ~/.goose/topic_agent_map.json
```

### Topic Commands

These commands work within group topics and are scoped to the topic's agent:

```
\topic register <agent>  # Manually map this topic to an agent
\topic sync              # Create topics for all agents that don't have one
\cancel                  # Cancel the topic's agent operation
\context                 # Show context usage for the topic's agent
\compact                 # Compact the topic's agent conversation
\model list              # List models for the topic's agent
\model <model_id>        # Set model for the topic's agent
\agent list              # List all agents (works in any topic)
```

### How It Works

1. **Topic Name Matching**: Topic names are matched case-insensitively to agent names
2. **Automatic Caching**: Once resolved, topic-to-agent mappings are cached persistently
3. **Background Sessions**: Agents started from topics don't change the active DM agent
4. **Lifecycle Events**: Topic creation/rename automatically updates the cache
5. **Attachments**: Photos and documents sent in topics route to the correct agent

### Naming Convention

Topic names should match agent names. For example:
- Topic "facebook_dev" → agent `facebook_dev`
- Topic "Goose Default" → agent `goose_default` (case-insensitive, spaces/underscores normalized)

If automatic matching fails, use `\topic register <agent>` to manually map a topic.

## Agent File Structure

Custom agents are stored as JSON files in `~/.goose/agents/`:
```json
{
  "name": "agent_name",
  "description": "Agent description",
  "instructions": "System instructions for the agent",
  "tools": [],
  "created_at": 1704067200.0,
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

## Conversation State Structure

Conversation states are stored in `~/.goose/bot_conversations/`:
```json
{
  "current_agent": "agent_name",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123",
  "timestamp": 1704067200.0,
  "working_directory": "/home/mark/git/telegram-goose-bot"
}
```

Sessions are automatically persisted by goose to `~/.goose/sessions/cli/`.

## Send File Skill

Goose can send files directly to you in Telegram. This works two ways:

1. **Via `\send` command**: Type `\send /path/to/file` in chat
2. **Via Goose skill**: Goose autonomously sends files when you ask (e.g., "send me that report")

### Skill Setup

The send-file skill is not included in git — create it manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.goose/skills/send-file
cat > ~/.goose/skills/send-file/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: send-file
description: Send a file to the user via Telegram. Use when you need to deliver a generated file, export, or any file to the user.
---

# Send File to User

Send a file to the user via Telegram by outputting the special marker `SEND_FILE:<path>` directly in your response message.

## Format

```
SEND_FILE:/absolute/path/to/file
```

## Rules

- Path MUST be absolute (start with `/` or use `$HOME`)
- File must exist and be under 50MB
- Output the `SEND_FILE:<path>` line directly in your assistant message text (do not use shell echo)
- Use `~` expansion is supported (e.g., `SEND_FILE:~/reports/output.pdf`)

## Example

```
SEND_FILE:/tmp/report.pdf
```

## When to Use

- User asks you to send/share/deliver a file
- You've generated a file the user needs (PDF, image, export, archive)
- User says "send me", "give me the file", "share that file"

### How It Works

When Goose includes `SEND_FILE:/path/to/file` in its response message text, the bot intercepts the `SEND_FILE:` pattern and sends the file via `bot.send_document()` to the correct chat or topic. The file is removed from Goose's response text.

## Setup

1. Copy settings template and configure:
```bash
cp settings.ini.template settings.ini
# Edit settings.ini with your bot token and authorized user
```

2. Setup and run:
```bash
# Setup virtual environment and run tests
make setup
make test

# Run the bot
make run
```

## Running as a Service

The bot runs as a user systemd service (no sudo required):

```bash
# Install and start service
make install
make service-start

# Check status and logs
make service-status
make service-logs

# Stop service
make service-stop
```

## How It Works

1. **Persistent Goose Session**: Starts `goose acp` and maintains JSON-RPC communication
2. **Structured Protocol**: Uses Agent Client Protocol (ACP) for reliable message exchange
3. **Permission Handling**: Automatically approves tool execution requests via ACP protocol
4. **Session Management**: Explicit session IDs for save/load functionality
5. **Streaming Updates**: Receives real-time notifications for tool calls and progress
6. **Smart Response Buffering**: Accumulates message chunks until turn completion
7. **Message Processing**: Sends user messages via JSON-RPC, receives structured responses
8. **Queue-Based Architecture**: Async Telegram layer communicates with sync Goose via message queue
9. **Telegram Integration**: Uses python-telegram-bot library with thread-safe async messaging

## Advantages over Text-Based Communication

- **True Persistence**: Single Goose ACP session maintains full context
- **Better Performance**: No process startup overhead per message
- **Structured Communication**: JSON-RPC eliminates text parsing and ANSI stripping
- **Real-time Progress**: See tool execution status as it happens
- **Reliable Cancellation**: Proper cancel mechanism via protocol
- **Error Recovery**: Handles timeouts and connection issues gracefully
- **Session Persistence**: Built-in session management with automatic persistence
- **Simpler Deployment**: Single Python file, easy to manage as service

## TODO / Future Enhancements

### Context Management
- ✅ **Context usage warnings**: Alert user when context window usage exceeds 80%
- ✅ **Context reset command**: Add command to clear context and start fresh
- **Automatic compaction**: Trigger compaction automatically at configurable threshold
- **Context usage history**: Track and display usage over time

### Tool Execution Feedback
- **Long-running tool notifications**: Show "Still running..." message for commands taking > 10 seconds
- **Tool execution time**: Display how long commands took to complete
- **Progress indicators**: Show progress for multi-step operations

### Error Handling

- ✅ **Message too long splitting**
  - Problem: Goose sometimes returns responses that exceed Telegram's 4096 character message limit, causing the message to fail to send entirely.
  - Found: `telegram.error.BadRequest: Message is too long` in journal logs (Apr 12 18:20).
  - Solution: Detect message length before sending and split into multiple sequential messages, preserving markdown formatting across chunks.

- ✅ **Prompt timeout handling**
  - Problem: Long-running Goose tasks (e.g. complex code generation, docker builds) exceed the prompt timeout, causing the request to fail and the user to get no response.
  - Found: `Exception: Timeout waiting for response to session/prompt` — ~20 occurrences across Apr 11–12, the most frequent error in the logs.
  - Solution: Make the prompt timeout configurable in `settings.ini`. Consider increasing the default, and send the user a notification when a timeout occurs rather than silently failing.

- ✅ **Prompt already in progress guard**
  - Problem: When a prompt times out, the user retries, but the original prompt is still running server-side. The retry hits `Prompt already in progress` and also fails.
  - Found: `Exception: JSON-RPC error: {'code': -32603, 'message': 'Internal error', 'data': 'Prompt already in progress'}` — ~10 occurrences, always following a timeout.
  - Solution: Track prompt state and prevent sending a new prompt while one is in-flight. Queue incoming messages and notify the user that a previous request is still processing. Optionally cancel the in-flight prompt before retrying.

- ✅ **Monthly usage limit handling**
  - Problem: When the Goose monthly usage limit is reached, every prompt fails with an unhandled exception. The bot keeps trying and failing on each user message.
  - Found: `Exception: JSON-RPC error: ... 'The monthly usage limit has been reached'` — 4 occurrences in quick succession (Apr 12 17:44–17:49) before the service was restarted.
  - Solution: Detect this specific error, notify the user with a friendly message ("Monthly usage limit reached — try again next month or check your plan"), and suppress further prompt attempts until the session is restarted or a configurable cooldown expires.

- ✅ **Transient network error recovery**
  - Problem: Occasional Telegram API connectivity issues cause unhandled exceptions that get logged but aren't recovered from gracefully.
  - Found: `telegram.error.NetworkError: httpx.ReadError:` (5 occurrences) and `telegram.error.NetworkError: Bad Gateway` (1 occurrence, Apr 12 02:10) in journal logs.
  - Solution: Add retry logic with exponential backoff for Telegram API calls. The python-telegram-bot library may already handle some retries — verify and configure appropriately. Register an error handler via `application.add_error_handler()` to catch and log these instead of letting them propagate unhandled.

- **Enhanced error messages**: Include more context and suggestions for common errors
- **Error recovery suggestions**: Provide actionable steps when operations fail
- **Retry mechanism**: Automatic retry for transient failures

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response time tracking**: Log and optionally display response times
- **Token usage display**: Show token consumption per message
- **Session statistics**: Track messages, tools used, errors per session

### Agent Management
- **Agent swap back**: Allow `\agent swap` (no name) to swap back to the previous agent
- **Prompt timeout investigation**: Review how chunk_timeout works — does it reset on each chunk received, or is it measured from send to end? Document and potentially make configurable
- **Typing indicator on agent swap**: Verify typing status is correctly updated when switching between agents — may not clear/set properly
- **Agent monitoring mode**: `\agent` with no subcommand enters monitoring mode — watches all running agents and notifies the user when any agent finishes (e.g., "✅ facebook_dev is finished and awaiting next instruction")
- ✅ **Agent list copy-to-clipboard**: Format agent names in `\agent list` so they are tappable/copyable in Telegram (using inline code formatting)

### User Experience
- **Configurable chunk timeout**: Per-user or per-agent timeout settings
- **Typing indicator customization**: Option to disable or adjust refresh rate
- **Tool output filtering**: Option to hide/show specific tool outputs
- **Message formatting options**: Markdown vs HTML, code highlighting preferences

### ACP Notifications (Unhandled)
- **Inbox notifications** (`_goose.dev/session/inbox_notification`): Shows when subagent results are delivered to the main agent (`messageCount`, `senders`). Could display "📬 Subagent results received (3)" so the user knows the main agent is processing subagent output.
- **Tool call chunks** (`_goose.dev/session/update` → `tool_call_chunk`): Streaming tool output from subagents (file contents, command output as it runs). Very noisy (~50/min during active subagent work). Could optionally show live subagent output, but would flood the chat without filtering/summarisation.
- **Commands available** (`_goose.dev/commands/available`): Full list of slash commands with descriptions, sent after session creation. Could validate commands in `\help`, provide autocomplete suggestions, or detect typos in user commands.

### ACP Features (Not Yet Implemented)
- **`/chat new`**: Start fresh conversation without restarting the goose process. Would avoid the full session restart overhead.
- **`/spawn`**: Explicitly kick off parallel agent sessions from Telegram. Fire-and-forget background tasks with completion notifications.
- **`/transcript`**: Review conversation history. Could be exposed as a `\transcript` bot command.
- **`_session/terminate`**: ✅ Implemented as `\subagents kill <name>`
